# AutoPackageDelivery

This repository contains all the information to develop the first version of an autonomous package delivery robot.
The project is based on 5 main topics:

* Design
* Indoor localization system
* SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
* Obstacle avoidance
* Autonomous parking

The core of the robot is managed by a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), running [Ubuntu 64-bit Server 20.04 LTS OS](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi). 

# Requirements


# Conection Instruction

1. Download and install Raspberry Pi OS from [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Insert a MicroSD in your computer, and install [Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS OS](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi). If your Raspberry Pi 3 allows you to install 64-bit OS select the 64-bit installation. Otherwise install the 32-bit OS.
3. Set up your Network conection \*\*\*\**Pendient*\*\*\*\*

From this point it will be possible to access the Raspberry Pi 3 from your Ubuntu system
